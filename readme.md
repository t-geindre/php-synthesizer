# PHP Synthesizer

Sound Synthesizer fully written in PHP.

Many thanks to [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA) and [his series about coding a synthesizer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgamhuQnOkM).

## Usage

First, run `composer install`. This is just used to enable class autoloading.

Then you can run `bin/play` that read the given song (located in `bin/songs` directory) and output wave content to stdout.

To play this content, you can :
 - Pipe it to a command that can read wave from stdin (eg Linux + AslaMixer: `bin/play tetris | aplay`)
 - Store it in a file and read it with any wave player: `bin/play tetris > tetris.wav`

Available songs are:
 - Tetris - `bin/play tetris` The Tetris theme (short)
 - He is a pirate - `bin/play he-is-a-pirate` A short part from the song from Pirate of the caribbean
 - C Majors scale - `bin/play c-major-scale` C Major scale played with built-in instruments

## Examples

If you just want to listen to some music generated by this code, just check the [examples](examples) directory.
